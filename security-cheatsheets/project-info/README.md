Security Cheatsheets
====================

This folder/readme contains some information for Dr. Wilson as part of our project for CIS4930 Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing. This folder will be deleted/moved to another repository after our project is graded.

As of now, we are unable to accept pull requests since this is a class project. Starting January 2014, open contributing to these cheatsheets will be allowed.
